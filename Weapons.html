                <p>
                    All knew the falcon's protection was a blessing of Favonius.
                    Few knew the blessing of Favonius was from a distant tribe.

                    Under the tyranny of the old nobles, Mondstadt cried for freedom.
                    Enslaved was the exiled foreign fighter in the land of wind.
                    Yet she knelt not before injustice and deception, but set a shining example.
                    For she overthrew the barbaric nobles and established a chivalric order and the Church.
                    Blessed was she to eventually walk with the gods.

                    and cut the throats of the sons of ancient sinners.

                    Mondstadt was once threatened by the shadow dragon Durin.
                    Its jealousy for Mondstadt's prosperity begot evil, poisoning the land.
                    In those dark days, Mondstadt was surrounded by monsters and barren lands.
                    Hearing the people's cry for help, the Anemo Archon descended and awoke Dvalin.
                    Dvalin rode the wind and soared up to the sky, fighting for all life.</p>

                <p>Legends tell that in ancient times, Barbartos summoned the four winds with the original version.
                    He thawed the snow, drove away vicious beasts, summoned rainfall, and created Mondstadt
                    He permitted the atlas to be shared and copied among the people, giving it the name of Cloud Atlas
                    Sadly, nothing survives the test of time. Certain drawings and odes were missing in the copies that
                    survived.
                    However, the knowledge passed on in the form of ballads and legends among the general public.
                    He who holds this atlas wields the true names of the thousand winds and all of their powers.</p>
